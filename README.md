SpencerianGuidelines
====================

Simple Prawn-powered ruby script for generating guidelines for Spencerian penmanship

I'm putting this out AS IS, and while it could use several improvements, I don't have much time for it at the moment.

In order to use it you need a working ruby installation, as well as the Prawn gem to generate PDF files.

The examples folder contains a few pre-generated sheets, in case you don't have a ruby installation handy.
